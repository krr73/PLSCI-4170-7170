        "  i) A reproducible analysis workflow includes a predictable input file and data structure, and outputs that are described, interpreted, and put in the context of the overall project in English.  \n",
        "  ii) The audience of this workflow is akin to someone who might be reviewing a manuscript derived from the work. The **most important audience is yourself, six months later**, or your close collaborators (e.g., lab group) who may need to carry on the work after you move on.  \n",

        "2. Writing a simple script and describing it.  \n",
        "3. Setting up a homework.  \n",
        "In principle, we should cover the ideas of the homework in class. You will then make a clean rmarkdown script to show the ideas. The rmarkdown script should be embedded in a `workflowr` directory. The questions to answer through the lab and homework will be indented text.  \n",

        "* If you write a series of functions that you will use repeatedly, it's probably worth [making a package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) out of them.  That is not trivial, but it's less difficult than it sounds.  You do not have to submit your package to **CRAN**, but can just use it internally.  The documentation of functions that goes along with making a package is very helpful over time.  \n",
        "* If you write a program that you imagine will develop over time, learn version control (probably \"git\"), [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) or [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git). Note that a public repository like github can be quite useful for making your data available once you publish your research. Jupyter makes it easy to pull notebooks from github and save changes back to github.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "* Here are some useful articles:\n",
        "  i) [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285)  \n",
